COM436 2D Coursework: "Dino Roll"

Intro 

The game is based around a dinosaur who’s aim is to collect as many berries as possible in order to bring home to his fellow dinosaurs. It begins with Dino being in the forest where he has to jump over a range of obstacles in order to get the berries. If he gets past a certain point there will be an easter egg waiting to be unlocked. This will take him to the clouds where the berries will be falling, but watch out it’s not as easy as he thinks. There is more than one type of berry and he can now change the color of his markings! Mixed berries can be collected by any color of skin, pink berries only by pink skin and purple berries only by purple skin. 

•	Art and Animation 
Within the game I have created all of the art by myself something that has proved to be harder than expected and taken up a lengthy amount of time. Creating my own game art was something I wanted to do from the beginning and in doing so I have gained good knowledge of Photoshop over the past few weeks. Walking images where something I complete however I never got the animation completed for it. 

•	Rolling Motion 
Dino rolling is something that I am particularly pleased with having created all of the images myself and then creating the animation for it. Getting used to the animator was a bit hard at the start; however over time it has became easier. At the start I was a little worried as to how I was going to be able get the effect of rolling in but it turns out to be one of the things I am most pleased with. 

•	Dead Splat 
Originally this wasn’t the effect that I was going for, however I think that it worked out pretty well. I thought it was particularly funny when he just floats along. 

•	Flying Dino 
Inspired by flappy bird I thought it would be quite fun to have Dino fly in the easter egg mode. The animation itself turned out to be a success as the wing flapping effect worked rather well. 


•	Programming 
As I didn’t follow a tutorial for the overall game the programming aspect was quite the challenge to ensure the game was how I envisaged it to be. Some of the things I followed a tutorial for were: 
o	Background Movement (www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bhkH7mtFNE)
o	Camera Tracks Player
(www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVLqLX4Yups)
o	Others: mybringback (youtube)
Other resources that I found helpful was the Unity online documentation. This was very handy to refer to at times. 

•	Spawning 
Getting the objects to spawn in is something that I am definitely proud to get working. Having them spawn in the correct place and ensuring they were at the correct height was hard. The hardest one was for the berries to get them to spawn in randomly in the easter egg level this took me some time, and also getting the to fall. To ensure that the levels don’t become cluttered with clones I also have them delete after so many seconds to help improve performance. 

•	Dino Following Mouse 
Having the player follow around after the mouse was a feature I particularly wanted to have. I tried having it like flappy bird when the user had to press space but then it was too difficult to get the berries as well. 

•	Sounds 
Some of the sounds I added in where placed in an array where within the script it would randomly choose which one it should play. Audocity was used to shortening down the length of the music as well as editing some of it.

•	Moving Clouds within easter egg level 
Having the moving clouds within the easter egg level was something I though I’d add in to make the level a little more difficult for the player. When they collide with one of them the will die and there will be a slight delay so that the player can see the dead splat animation. 

•	Score(database using MySQL on Dunluce server) 
Score from the first level will be carried onto the easter level, when the player dies it will then produce the end screen to enable them to type in their name along with their score and submit it. Within the highscore page the user will then be able to go and see the top 5 scores.
